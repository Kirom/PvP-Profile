# PvP Profile v1.0.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.1

## Overview

This is a performance-focused update that optimizes the Classic WoW detection mechanism to improve overall addon performance.

## Changes

### Performance Optimization

**Classic WoW Detection Caching**
- **What Changed**: The addon now caches the Classic WoW detection result instead of checking it repeatedly across different modules
- **Why**: This eliminates redundant API calls and improves performance
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Added `ns.config.isClassicWoW` configuration property to store the detection result
  - Updated `checkpvp.lua`, `provider_registry.lua`, and `menu.lua` to use the cached value
  - Reduces the number of `WOW_PROJECT_ID` checks from multiple per context to once per session

## Known Issues
